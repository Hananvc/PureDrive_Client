                  You can find EV car deals by exploring manufacturer websites, checking local dealerships, and browsing online marketplaces. Websites like Electrek and CleanTechnica offer news and updates on deals. Additionally, government incentives and end-of-year sales can provide attractive offers. Don't forget to negotiate and consider used or certified pre-owned EVs for potential savings.
